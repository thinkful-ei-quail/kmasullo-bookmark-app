I'm not sure that this is what is meant by "list all user stories completed."

1. Users can add bookmarks that contain a title, url, description and rating.
2. Condensed bookmarks appear at the opening of the page.
3. Users can clock on the bookmarks to expand, exposing a description and link.
4. Users can delete bookmarks.
5. If a user has failed to enter a title or url, an error message appears.
6. Users can sort bookmarks.
